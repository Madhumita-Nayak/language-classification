# Language Classification of social media posts in English script

#### Most of the times people post comments on social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. which do not follow any particular convention or format. This results in highly unstructured data being generated on a daily basis. These posts often contain linguistic and stylistic variations which make it difficult to analyze the text. Also people prefer expressing themselves in their mother-tongue using English script. So identifying the language of the text becomes a challenging task. We aim to classify the social media posts according to the language they are written in. We have used a supervised learning approach for classifying two languages namely Hindi and English.The interactive texts in the form of posts, comments, messages etc. from various social media platforms based on the languages used but written in English script are classified. Currently we have implemented using only two languages that is English and Hindi.I would like to introduce more number of classes(Indian languages).
